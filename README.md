Car Price Prediction using Regression
</head>
<body>
<h1>Car Price Prediction using Regression</h1>
    
<p>This project demonstrates a <strong>car price prediction model</strong> built using regression techniques on a Kaggle dataset.</p>
    
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The aim of this project is to accurately predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, engine type, year, and more. This project serves as a valuable resource for those looking to understand how regression models can be applied to predict continuous variables in a real-world dataset.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for this project is sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> and contains details of cars, including their brand, body type, engine size, fuel type, and price. The data has been preprocessed and encoded to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
        <li><strong>Framework:</strong> PySpark</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Regression model from PySpark MLlib</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Data preprocessing and feature engineering using PySpark</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repository:</li>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/shrish01/BreadcrumbsCar-Regression-Analysis-Kaggle</code></pre>
        <li>Install required dependencies:</li>
        <pre><code>pip install pyspark</code></pre>
        <li>Run the Jupyter notebook or script file to preprocess the data and train the model.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Model</h2>
    <p>The model used for this project is a <strong>linear regression model</strong> implemented using PySpark's MLlib. The model has been trained to predict car prices based on the available features with an evaluation metric of RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The model performance is evaluated using RMSE, and sample predictions are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions made by the model.</p>
